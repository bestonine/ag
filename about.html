    <h1>Building the Future of Browser Gaming</h1>
    <p style="max-width:800px;margin:16px auto 0;font-size:1.15em">CAKE TOPPER represents a sweet vision: delivering delightful gaming experiences without downloads, installations, or compromise. We're a team of engineers, designers, and baking enthusiasts united by one belief—gaming should be instant, accessible, and fun.</p>

    <h2>Our Origin Story</h2>
    <p style="font-size:1.05em;line-height:1.7">
      CAKE TOPPER was born from inspiration. As avid gamers and home bakers, we grew tired of waiting for massive downloads and wanted to create something sweet and instantly shareable. We asked ourselves: what if we could build a game as satisfying as decorating a real cake?
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:1.05em;line-height:1.7;margin-top:16px">
      In early 2024, our founding team—three game developers, two physics engineers, and a UX designer—gathered in a kitchen with a simple mission: create a decorating game that runs flawlessly in any browser, on any device, with zero compromise on fun. Eighteen months, countless coffees, and 50,000 lines of optimized JavaScript later, CAKE TOPPER was served.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:1.05em;line-height:1.7;margin-top:16px">
      What started as a passion project has grown into a thriving community with over 50,000 active bakers worldwide. But we're just getting started. Every day, we're pushing the boundaries of what's possible with web technology, proving that the future of gaming isn't locked behind app stores or expensive hardware—it's right here in your browser.

    <h2>The Technology Behind the Treat</h2>
    <p style="font-size:1.05em;margin-bottom:24px">
      Building a high-performance decorating game that runs entirely in the browser isn't easy. Here's a glimpse into our technical philosophy and the innovations that make CAKE TOPPER possible:

      <div style="margin-bottom:24px">
        <strong style="display:block;font-size:1.1em;margin-bottom:8px">⚡ Custom Canvas Rendering Engine</strong>
        <p style="margin:0;opacity:0.9;line-height:1.6">
          We built our rendering engine from scratch using HTML5 Canvas API, optimizing every draw call for maximum performance. Our engine handles complex particle systems, dynamic lighting, and real-time shadows without sacrificing frame rate.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div style="margin-bottom:24px">
        <strong style="display:block;font-size:1.1em;margin-bottom:8px">🍬 Real-Time Topping Physics</strong>
        <p style="margin:0;opacity:0.9;line-height:1.6">
          Using advanced collision detection algorithms and particle physics, we simulate the delightful flow and bounce of sprinkles and icing. Every decoration is a unique, physics-based creation.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div style="margin-bottom:24px">
        <strong style="display:block;font-size:1.1em;margin-bottom:8px">🌐 WebSocket Multiplayer Infrastructure</strong>
        <p style="margin:0;opacity:0.9;line-height:1.6">
          Our multiplayer system uses WebSockets for ultra-low latency communication, combined with client-side prediction and server reconciliation to ensure smooth co-op decorating even on unstable connections.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong style="display:block;font-size:1.1em;margin-bottom:8px">📦 Aggressive Asset Optimization</strong>
        <p style="margin:0;opacity:0.9;line-height:1.6">
          Through procedural generation, texture atlasing, and compression techniques, we've reduced our initial payload to under 2MB. Additional assets load progressively in the background, keeping initial load times under 3 seconds on 4G connections.
